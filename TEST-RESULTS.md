# KhoChuan POS Test Results

## Issues Fixed

### Authentication Tests

1. **Selectors Issue**: 
   - Problem: `getByText('KhoChuan POS')` was finding multiple elements on the page
   - Fix: Updated to use `getByRole('heading', { name: 'ðŸ“¦ KhoChuan POS' })` for more specificity

2. **Login Functionality**:
   - Problem: `Login.jsx` was passing `username` as `email` which didn't match expected parameters
   - Fix: Updated login to pass both parameters `username` and `email` for backward compatibility

### Dashboard Tests

1. **Navigation Issues**:
   - Problem: Incorrect URL was used for navigating to login page (`/` instead of `/login`)
   - Fix: Updated URL to `/login` to ensure consistent navigation

2. **Selector Issues**:
   - Problem: Using raw CSS selectors like `input[type="text"]` that weren't finding elements
   - Fix: Updated to use Playwright's more robust selector API like `getByPlaceholder()`

3. **Timeouts**:
   - Problem: Default timeouts were too short for some operations
   - Fix: Added explicit timeouts (5000ms) for critical operations

### POS Terminal Tests

1. **Login Flow**:
   - Problem: Same selector issues as other tests
   - Fix: Standardized selectors across all test files

2. **Error Handling**:
   - Problem: Some tests were failing due to navigation issues 
   - Fix: Added better error handling and timeouts

### Visual Regression Tests

1. **Selector Issues**:
   - Problem: Could not find login form elements consistently
   - Fix: Updated with consistent selectors

2. **File Naming**:
   - Problem: Inconsistent screenshot naming
   - Fix: Standardized naming convention for visual regression snapshots

### Auth Helper

1. **API Issues**:
   - Problem: `auth.js` was using different selectors than the ones that were working
   - Fix: Updated the helper to use the confirmed working selectors

2. **Missing Imports**:
   - Problem: Missing `expect` import in auth helper
   - Fix: Added proper import

## Test Coverage

The tests now cover:

1. Authentication (login/logout)
2. Dashboard functionality
3. POS terminal operations
4. Visual regression testing

## Known Limitations

1. Some dashboard tests still fail due to missing components in the UI (metrics cards, etc.)
2. Visual regression tests may fail if running for the first time due to missing baseline screenshots
3. Some fixtures may need to be created (badge.png for visual testing)

## Next Steps

1. Create necessary fixtures for visual regression tests
2. Update the dashboard UI to include metrics and cards
3. Add more specific tests for inventory and customer management
4. Set up proper CI/CD pipeline for automated testing
