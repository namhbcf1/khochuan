### 4. Implementation Details

#### Customer Segmentation

The customer segmentation feature uses RFM analysis to categorize customers:

1. **Recency**: Days since last purchase (lower is better)
2. **Frequency**: Number of purchases (higher is better)
3. **Monetary**: Total spend amount (higher is better)

Customers are scored on a 1-5 scale for each dimension, then segmented into groups:
- Champions (4.5-5.0): Best customers
- Loyal (3.5-4.5): Regular buyers
- Potential Loyalists (3.0-3.5): Recent customers with average frequency
- New Customers (2.5-3.0): First-time buyers
- Promising (2.0-2.5): Recent customers with low frequency but good spending
- Needs Attention (1.5-2.0): Above average recency/frequency but low monetary
- At Risk (1.0-1.5): Previous loyal customers who haven't purchased recently
- Can't Lose (0.5-1.0): Customers who spent big but a long time ago
- Lost (0.0-0.5): Lowest scores in all categories

#### Demand Forecasting

The demand forecasting feature predicts future product demand using:

1. **Historical Sales Analysis**: Analyzing past sales patterns
2. **Trend Detection**: Linear regression to identify upward/downward trends
3. **Seasonal Factors**: Day-of-week patterns in sales data
4. **Inventory Optimization**: Calculating optimal stock levels, reorder points, and safety stock

The algorithm provides:
- Predicted demand for specified time period
- Confidence level of prediction
- Trend direction (increasing, decreasing, stable)
- Seasonal factors by day of week
- Inventory recommendations

#### Price Optimization

The price optimization feature recommends optimal pricing based on:

1. **Price Elasticity**: How demand changes with price
2. **Competitor Analysis**: Comparing prices with competitors
3. **Margin Calculation**: Ensuring minimum profit margins
4. **Strategy-Based Optimization**: Different algorithms for profit maximization, revenue maximization, or market share

The system provides:
- Recommended price
- Price change percentage
- Expected impact on demand, revenue, and margin
- Reasoning behind recommendation
- Market analysis insights

#### Product Recommendations

The product recommendations feature suggests products using:

1. **Purchase History**: Products related to past purchases
2. **Collaborative Filtering**: "Customers who bought this also bought..."
3. **Category Affinity**: Products from categories the customer frequently buys from
4. **Cart Analysis**: Complementary products to items in cart

The recommendations include:
- Product details (name, description, price, image)
- Recommendation reason
- Confidence level
